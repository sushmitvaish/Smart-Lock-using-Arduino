# Smart-Lock-using-Arduino

Internet of Things (IoT) Enabled Assistive Care Services Using Smart Lock refers to locking/unlocking of the door without any physical contact with the door. 
People especially those who are physically disabled or are aged can be benefited from this device as it can help them to lock/unlock the door remotely. Remote locking/unlocking can be done using two ways, either by knocking pattern detection or by using the application on phone. Two technologies are used here, Arduino for knocking pattern detection and NodeMCU for locking/unlocking using the phone. NodeMCU has a lead over Arduino technology as it has inbuilt wifi module which proves to be cost effective.
